Hello, my name is Arka! I'm a first year P.h.D student at Cornell Tech, being advised by Professors Tom Ristenpart and Nicola Dell. My interests are broadly in studying usable security and privacy issues in at-risk populations. Before Cornell, I completed my B.S and M.S in Computer Science at the University of Washington, where I conducted research with Professors Tadayoshi Kohno and Franziska Roesner.
